# pokerole-tools
Hello everyone. This is a project to make logic and tools to run Pok√©role on multiple VTT's. I will get to adding a better readme in the future, but for now, here are the primary basics if you wish to contribute:

1. ~~I need to update this...~~
2. Do not circumvent the `.editorconfig`. It is there for a reason. Primarilly, consitantly formatted code. And, yes, we are using tabs.

If you wish to run the *.tt files, you will need to install https://github.com/RdJNL/TextTemplatingCore since the default visual studio thing is being stupid
