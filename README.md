# pokerole-tools
Hello everyone. This is a project to make logic and tools to run Pok√©role on multiple VTT's. I will get to adding a better readme in the future, but for now, here are the primary basics if you wish to contribute:
1. Please. Please please, oh please, ***write your code right the first time***. If I had a choice inbetween having this done tomorrow and having the code written corectly so we don't have to fix a bug every other day, I would choose the latter.<br>
2. Do not circumvent the `.editorconfig`. It is there for a reason. Primarilly, consitantly formatted code. And, yes, we are using tabs.
