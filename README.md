# pokerole-tools
Hello everyone. This is a project to make logic and tools to run Pok√©role on multiple VTT's. I will get to adding a better readme in the future, but for now, here are the primary basics if you wish to contribute:
1. ~~Please. Please please, oh please, ***write your code right the first time***. If I had a choice inbetween having this done tomorrow and having the code written corectly so we don't have to fix a bug every other day, I would choose the latter.~~<br>
	* ~~[![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_general_problem.png "I find that when someone's taking time to do something right in the present, they're a perfectionist with no ability to prioritize, whereas when someone took time to do something right in the past, they're a master artisan of great foresight.")](https://xkcd.com/974/)~~
	* ~~It really does save time, it has happened more than once already.~~
2. Ignore that previous one for now. I need more help and asking everyone to be perfect is not going to help.
3. Do not circumvent the `.editorconfig`. It is there for a reason. Primarilly, consitantly formatted code. And, yes, we are using tabs.

If you wish to run the *.tt files, you will need to install https://github.com/RdJNL/TextTemplatingCore since the default visual studio thing is being stupid
